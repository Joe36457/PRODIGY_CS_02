To encrypt an image, pixel values are modified so that the image can be interpreted only if the decryption key is available. Pixel manipulation is the technique employed. Substitution, permutation, and bit-plane slicing are some of the methods used in this process. Block-based encryption is just one of the ways used to carry out block by block encryption in which these algorithms are applied autonomously by the individual pixels.

The following code will help you understand how to create a Shuffler class which is used to achieve a basic encryption and decryption of pixels in pictures. It has defined the logic inside a ImageShuffler class with distinct methods for encrypting and decrypting files. This modular approach is devoid of security since there is little complexity involving the shuffling algorithm used during encryption and poor key administration. Here we have swapped the pixels in the image in order to achieve encryption and the decrypted image displays the actual image which was submitted for encryption which basically returns back to its normal form from the swapped pixels form.
